<p>title:“lit Review” author:“Cierra Bustamantes” date:‘2023-01-26’
output: html_document: theme: cosmo — Social media has become more
popular and prevalent in our everyday lives with Instagram, Twitter,
TikTok, and other apps keeping nearly everyone connected to their
friends through a screen and mindlessly scrolling for hours to see the
latest post. This increase in influence has led to negative impacts on
mood, self-esteem, self-perception, and mental health. Our study aims to
find the effect of comparing oneself to the bodies of women in Instagram
posts and how this can impact body image. Body image and
self-perception, used in this case interchangeably, is how a person
views and feels about their body, looks, and attractiveness. Literature
Review The Relationship between Media and Body Image Studies on the
effects of viewing photos of thin actresses and models have been
conducted for years. It was determined that watching tv can cause body
dissatisfaction (Eisend and Möller, 2007), including commercials of thin
women which were found to cause an increase of eating disorder
symptomatology and body dissatisfaction (Grabe et al., 2008). In fact,
multiple studies have found that viewing images of thin models has
detrimental effects on women’s body satisfaction (Groesz et al., 2001;
Moreno-Domínquez et al., 2019; Rounds and Stutts, 2021). However, body
satisfaction improves when the models being depicted are plus sized
(Moreno-Domínquez et al., 2019; Groesz et al., 2001) or average sized
(Groesz et al., 2001). Moreno-Domínquez et al. (2019) had participants
fill out the Body Satisfaction Questionnaire, which assesses how much
time the participant thinks about their body shape and size, prior to
being called and asked to be part of a fashion marketing experiment.
Each group was shown a slideshow consisting of images of models, and
asked to compare their own bodies with those of the models. This study
showed one group images of thin models—those with a BMI below 19—and
another group images of overweight models—those with a BMI of over 26
(610). After viewing the slideshow, participants once again took the
Body Satisfaction Questionnaire which allowed the researchers to compare
what body-image concerns were constant, and what seemed to be influenced
by the stimuli presented. Groesz et al.’s (2001) meta-analysis looked at
articles studying the relationship between media and body satisfaction.
The inclusion criteria were that the studies sampled females; stimuli
showed the entire body of thin models; studies that had control groups
that were shown images of average models, overweight models, attractive
nonmodels, or objects; and measurement of body dissatisfaction or
physical attractiveness (7). Overall, their analysis showed that viewing
images of thin models lowered body satisfaction more than viewing images
of average models, objects, or overweight models. Also, samples that had
more body issues affected more negatively than samples with lower body
image issues, and that those under 19 years old were affected more
negatively than those 19 and older (11). Rounds and Stutts (2021) had
female college students’ complete questionnaires on body satisfaction,
disordered eating attitudes and behaviors, and visual analog scales on
state body satisfaction and negative mood. One group viewed images of
all fitspiration images, another all travel images, and the third group
viewed half fitspiration images and half travel images. The fitspiration
images came from the #fitspiration page on Instagram and showed images
of women in the gym or posing while wearing workout clothing. These
women were either toned or thin. The travel images were from the #travel
page and had no people depicted. To ensure that participants were paying
attention to the images, they were asked to explain each photo in a
sentence (270). Their findings revealed that not only did the
fitspiration group have lower body satisfaction and a more negative mood
than the other groups, but that even the group that viewed both
fitspiration and travel images had lower body satisfaction and more
negative mood than the control group (272). Another study found that
young girls and college women who viewed photos of sexualized athletes
made more comments focused on attractiveness and appearance, commented
more positively on the athlete’s body, and made more objectifying and
negative comments about their own bodies (Daniels, 2012). The
participants who viewed images of athletes that depicted them playing
their sport made comments focusing on the athlete and their own physical
skills and made more comments about physical activity and sports than
appearance (Daniels, 2012). The rise of social media has led to more
recent studies that focus on how the presence of these apps in our
everyday lives impacts the body image of users. They have found that
restrained eating was associated with posting selfies online (Niu et
al., 2020), and that using social networking sites was correlated with
internalization of societal beauty standards, high body consciousness,
and dieting (Tiggemann &amp; Slater, 2013). Societal beauty standards
set the expectation that women will be thin and have attractive
features, and put pressure to conform to this image (Jung and Lennon,
2003). There is also a correlation between the use of these sites and
loneliness (Pop et al., 2022). A study also found that self-esteem was
lower in participants who viewed a photo that allowed for upward
comparison, while photos that caused downward comparison did not cause
as much change in self-esteem (Vogel et al., 2014). The researchers
describe upward comparison as comparing oneself to someone or something
that is viewed as superior, whereas downward comparison is comparing
oneself to someone or something that is thought of as inferior (Vogel et
al., 2014, 206). What is downward and upward comparison? This conclusion
on upward comparison is supported by another study that found that
exposure to images of thin women working out was found to lower body
satisfaction and increase negative moods, even when shown alongside
images that did not depict any people (Rounds and Stutts, 2021). Factors
that Increase Vulnerability These studies have also found that some
girls and women are especially vulnerable to the harmful impacts of
using social media. In fact, Aubrey (2006) found that sexually
objectifying media only impacts women that are easily influenced by
media exposure, and that the negative impact is caused by comparing
oneself to these images. Other studies have found that comparison is
more likely when the image that is being viewed reflects the ideal body
type of the participant (Clayton et al., 2017; Aubrey, 2006) and that
higher levels of comparison are related to having more depressive
symptomatology (Sinclair &amp; Jordan, 2022). Clayton et al. (2017)
found that the decrease in body satisfaction was related to the
participants’ disappointment with themselves at not having achieved
their body goals. This accounted for the decrease in effect as the
models grew larger, because the participants were no longer viewing the
image as a body that they could, but failed to achieve (Clayton et al.,
2017). Pre-existing body concerns and identification with beauty
standards also increase vulnerability to negative impacts caused by the
media. What are pre-existing body concerns? Niu et al. (2020) found that
self-objectification causes negative emotions, increases body
evaluations, and increases the pursuit of sexiness and attractiveness.
Women who accepted societal beauty standards that encourage women to
look a certain way to be considered attractive (which beauty standards?)
were more likely to be affected by the media because it reinforced these
standards (Grabe et al., 2008). Women who accept the standards place
more importance on appearance, which is related to having poor body
image, low self-esteem, and negative mood (Jung &amp; Lennon, 2003). Niu
et al.’s (2020) finding that selfie-posting led to restrained eating was
not caused necessarily by the selfies, but as an attempt to improve
their bodies because of their increased focus on appearance and the
self-objectification that occurred as a result of posting images of
themselves online. Women who already had poor body satisfaction were
also more affected by media (Grabe et al., 2008; Groesz et al., 2001).
Moreno-Domínquez et al. (2019) found that images of thin models
especially harmed women that already struggled with poor body image, and
Aubrey (2006) found that women with low self-esteem were particularly
affected by sexually objectifying media, this was defined in their study
as television and magazines that portrayed sexual desirability as being
derived mainly from a woman’s appearance and body. The Present Study The
above literature suggests that the use of social media, particularly
media that portrays thin women as the ideal beauty (Moreno-Domínquez et
al., 2019; Niu et al., 2020; Groesz et al., 2001; Rounds and Stutts,
2021; Eisend and Möller, 2007) or media that is sexually objectifying
(Aubrey, 2006; Daniels, 2012), has an effect on a person’s perception of
themselves. It causes them to internalize their belief that they do not
meet these standards, which can result in harmful behaviors like
restrained eating as they attempt to lose weight and become more
sexually attractive (Niu et al., 2020; Tiggemann &amp; Slater, 2013) and
lead to over negative feelings about themselves such as low self-esteem,
loneliness, depressive symptomatology, and body dissatisfaction
(Sinclair &amp; Jordan, 2022; Clayton et al., 2017; Rounds and Stutts,
2021; Pop et al., 2022; Grabe et al., 2008). Be more specific, what
media and how does it effect someone’s perception? Every social media
platform has an algorithm that recommends posts to a user based on their
likes and dislikes in order to provide content that will keep the
consumer on their platform for longer. This algorithm means that many
users get caught mindlessly scrolling to find posts that they enjoy,
while not recognizing the impact that these posts are having on them.
The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between social
media and self-perception. We hypothesize that women’s self-perception
will be negatively impacted by the social media posts from the #fitspo
page, and that the women in this group will have higher PASTAS scores
after viewing the images, indicating more anxiety about their
appearance. We also believe that women’s self-perception will be
positively impacted in the #bodypositivity group, and that the women in
this group will have lower PASTAS scores which would indicate less
anxiety about their appearance.</p>
