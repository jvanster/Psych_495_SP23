## This is an example Quarto File

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

This Website has all the info you'll need to work on quarto files

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
58/7
```

```{r}
#Carmen was here again
```

```{r}
8+5
```

```{r}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
library(readxl)
```

```{r}
experiment_ANCOVA = aov(Years ~ Skin_Hue + Bad, data = experiment_data)
```

```{experiment_ANCOVA}

```

```{r}
experiment_ANCOVA

```

```{r} 
t.test(Years ~ Skin_Hue, data = experiment_data)

```



```{r}
##run an ancova} \## IV = Skin_Hue \## DV = Years \## Co-V = Bad

ANCOVA <- aov(Years ~ Skin_Hue + Bad, data = experiment_data)
```

Look at the results

```{r}
Anova(ANCOVA, type = "III")
```

Look at the structure of the variables
```{r} 
str(experiment_data)
```         


Two-Way ANOVA
```{r}
Two_Way_Anova <- aov(Years ~ Hispanic1 + Non_Hispanic +
                       Hispanic1*Non_Hispanic, data = experiment_data)

```
