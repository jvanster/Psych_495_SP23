## __Abstract__


The Hispanic community has people of all skin hues. Research shows that for incarcerated people skin hue can have an effect on how long their sentencing is. This study dives into the possible biases of Fresno Pacific Students concerning skin hue and punishment of a Hispanic man. Using photoshop 72 participants are told a man committed armed robbery and then shown either a light-skinned mugshot or a dark-skinned mugshot and asked to sentence the man. With a large Hispanic sample population, colorism was tested and there was no significant difference on sentence length of both mugshots. This shows that in the population used there was no significant colorism against the dark-skinned mug shot and no significant favoritism to the light-skinned mugshot. This is a pilot study that with further testing could help shed light on different ethnicities biases in colorism.
