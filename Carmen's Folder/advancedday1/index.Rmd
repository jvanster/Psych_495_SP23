Topic Statement


My topic is skin hue and punishment among the Hispanic community. If a Hispanic man does the same crime will his skin hue matter when it comes to sentencing his punishment? Lots of research is done for black American men. I would like to see if these skin hue biases exist for Hispanic men too. I want to see if there are biases among undergraduate students. I have my guess that darker skin hue will have harsher punishments. I am leaning towards only two versions of a mug shot, the same model with photoshopped skin hue (using NIS skin color scale). Same crime story, same punishment questions at the end.
